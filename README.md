About project:

Our-kahoot is a game-based learning platform used to review students' knowledge, for formative assessment or as a break from traditional classroom activities.

Create a fun learning game in minutes. The format and number of questions is up to you. Add videos, images and diagrams to your questions to amplify engagement.

Kahoots are best played in a group setting. Players answer on their own devices, while questions are displayed on a shared screen.
